		<h1>
			I am a Senior Researcher with a PhD in Human–Computer Interaction and currently work at BMW on the design of interfaces for advanced automotive systems. 
			My work combines user experience engineering, design theory, and cognitive science, with a focus on interaction, autonomy, and the epistemic structures of design. 
			Since 2009, I have collaborated on both digital and analog projects and have been involved in peer review and occasional teaching activities. 
			I have received recognition from the German Design Award Council. But enough about me, now <a href="mailto:info@graph.ist">tell me</a> about your project!
