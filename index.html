			I’m a senior researcher with a Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction. Currently, I work at BMW developing in-car user interfaces and interaction concepts. 
			Since 2009, I’ve contributed to numerous projects for both digital and analog mediums, earning recognition from the German Design Award Council. 
			I collaborate with other studios on a project-based basis and occasionally give lectures. 
			<br><br>
			If you are curious, I also curate a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/design.matters/library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database</a> where I collect resources that inspire my research practice, and ideas for <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/synthetic-synthesis-on-design/id1786764068" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcasting</a>.
			But enough about me, now <a href="mailto:info@graph.ist"> tell me</a> about your project!
