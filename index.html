			I am a Senior Researcher with a PhD in Human–Computer Interaction and currently work at BMW on interface design for advanced systems. 
			My work combines design theory, cognitive and computer science, with a focus on interaction and the epistemic structures of design. 
			Since 2009, I have collaborated on digital and analog projects and have received recognition from the German Design Award Council.
			But enough about me, now <a href="mailto:info@graph.ist">tell me</a> about your project!
