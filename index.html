		<h1>
			I’m a senior researcher with a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction. Currently, I work at BMW developing in-car user interfaces and interaction concepts. Since 2009, I’ve contributed to numerous projects for both digital and analog mediums, earning recognition from the German Design Award Council. I collaborate with other studios on a project-based basis and occasionally give lectures.<br><br>
			If you are curious, I curate a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/design.matters/library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database</a> where I collect resources that inspire my research practice. But enough about me, now <a href="mailto:info@graph.ist">tell me</a> about your project!
