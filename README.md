### Design & Typography

The site embraces a minimal aesthetic that prioritizes content and readability. The interactive dark mode toggle (activated by clicking the site's monogram) reflects an intentional approach to user agency—visitors control their viewing experience. This design choice embodies principles of user-centered interaction design, where interface elements serve function while maintaining conceptual clarity.

The typographic system employs a deliberate pairing that creates a brief narrative arc. **[Brown](https://lineto.com/typefaces/brown)** by Lineto serves as the primary typeface for body text—a contemporary sans-serif representing modernity and clarity in interaction design discourse. Brown's geometric precision and humanist warmth make it ideal for extended reading while maintaining professional authority. Paired with this is **[Rusch-GoticoAntiqua](https://github.com/anrt-type/GoticoAntiqua/blob/master/fonts/Rusch-GoticoAntiqua100G.otf)**, a transitional typeface that bridges gothic and roman traditions, used exclusively for the site's monogram. This proto-roman form represents historical continuity in typographic evolution. The pairing of a historical transitional form with a modern sans-serif creates a conceptual tension that mirrors the epistemic dialogue between design theory and contemporary practice, establishing a visual dialogue between tradition and innovation—core themes in human-computer interaction research.
