### Design & Typography

The site uses a minimal design prioritizing readability. The dark mode toggle (click the monogram) gives visitors control over their viewing experience—a core principle of user-centered design.
The typography pairs **[Brown](https://lineto.com/typefaces/brown)** by Lineto, a modern sans-serif for body text, with **[Rusch-GoticoAntiqua](https://github.com/anrt-type/GoticoAntiqua/blob/master/fonts/Rusch-GoticoAntiqua100G.otf)**, a transitional typeface for the monogram. Brown provides geometric clarity for extended reading, while Rusch-GoticoAntiqua—bridging gothic and roman traditions—represents typographic evolution. This pairing creates visual tension between historical forms and contemporary design, reflecting the dialogue between design theory and practice central to HCI research.
